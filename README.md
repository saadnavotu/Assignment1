# Student Portfolio Website
This is a responsive portflio website for my Networking and IT Security coursework. It includes pages for Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact form.

## Responsive Design
- Laptop/Desktop: The main wrapper is set to 66% width and centered. This keeps the content readable on large screens.

- Tablet: The wrapper uses 98% width to fill most of the screen, making use of available space.

- Phone: The wrapper is 100% width with no margin, so content fits the whole screen.

## Linear Gradient
- I used a linear gradient on the contact page (contact.html) more specifically under the .contact-main class

- The gradient goes left to right: linear-gradient(to right, #FFF461 0%, #DEAE54 50%, #F59169 100%)

## Color Scheme
- My color palette is from Adobe Color:
    - Yellow: #FFF461
    - Gold: #DEAE54
    - Peach-Orange: #F59169
    - Pink: #DE548B
    - Purple: #C06DFA

- I chose this specific palette because I wanted my contact page to have a nice bright and vibrant look to it, and more importantly I like the happy color trend this adobe palette was giving. 

- These colors are used for backgrounds, navigation links, gradients, and buttons.

## Validation
- HTML and CSS were validated using W3C tools.
- Links were checked with the W3c Link Checker.
- Accessibility was tested with WAVE and passed.
